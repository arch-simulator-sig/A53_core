# DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Makefile for building Verilated archive or executable
#
# Execute this makefile from the object directory:
#    make -f Vrvcpu.mk

default: /home/fluctlight/project/oscpu/projects/cpu/build_test/emu

### Constants...
# Perl executable (from $PERL)
PERL = perl
# Path to Verilator kit (from $VERILATOR_ROOT)

### Switches...
# C++ code coverage  0/1 (from --prof-c)
VM_PROFC = 0
# SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
VM_SC = 0
# Legacy or SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
VM_SP_OR_SC = $(VM_SC)
# Deprecated
VM_PCLI = 1
# Deprecated: SystemC architecture to find link library path (from $SYSTEMC_ARCH)
